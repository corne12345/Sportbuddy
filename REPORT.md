Sportbuddy is an application designed to help the user quantify its caloric intake on a so called cheat day and guide them through the process of compensating for this cheating by means of exercise. The user will fill in its intake and its activity of choice and the app will calculate the required duration to compensate this input. The user will be guided by a timer and followed by GPS on a map.

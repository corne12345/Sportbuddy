# Design Document
## SportBuddy

The five different screens and used API's and its connections are shown in figure 1. This shows that all the different screens of the app just follow one another in a logical way. It is possible to go back, but there is no complicated interrelatedness between it all. 

The app uses functionality from the Google Maps API and the nutritional API Nutritionix. The second API is not only able to give nutritional information of certain foods, but is also able to read complete menus and sentences. Nutritionix can be used by sending requests. JSON-formatted returns are expected, which can be peeled down to isolate the required input.
